			<p>Whether your child hates the written form of communication or just loves to write, any child can be taught to write and even have fun doing it. Trust me; I have had both types of students. The key is to capitalize on their wonderful imaginations and their innate love of playing with language. Each student will have the opportunity to “publish” their writing in a class anthology at the end of the spring semester. Basic punctuation will be covered through the focused self-editing. The peer review method is used to enable your child to receive positive feed back from their peers and corrective feed back through asking questions about the writing piece. My goal is that your child will begin to appreciate the writing process and expand their writing abilities. Each student will have the opportunity to “publish” their writing in a class anthology at the end of the spring semester. All lessons will be taught in class however, parents will be expected to help children complete their assignments at home. This semester we will concentrate on poetry, creative writing, and response to literature.</p>
