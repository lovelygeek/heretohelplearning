				<h2>Hands on Learning for Home School Children</h2>
			</hgroup>
			<p>We have home-schooled for over fifteen years. Our family's goal in education and daily prayer for our children has always been to grow in the wisdom of our savior, Jesus Christ. (Proverbs 2:1-6) We believe that true education results from an understanding that God is the center of all things. (1 John 1-5) and that includes every subject that is taught in school. We also believe that every area of education is to be fun and full of wonder and discovery.</p> 
			<p>Over the years, we have combined the hands on unit study approach, the <a href="http://simplycharlottemason.com/">Charlotte Mason's philosophy of teaching</a> and the God given gift of our children's play and imagination to provide an enriching learning experience. </p>
			<p>More than half of our family has grown and "left the nest", or gone on to high school, resulting in a very quiet nest. And honestly, we are not sure how to home school only one child. The "more the merrier" has been our motto and so we invite your child to join our learning adventure! <a href="http://heretohelplearning.com/classes.php">Check out our catalogue!</a></p>

			<p>Here to Help Learning was conceived by a passion to encourage, challenge and simply offer help to home-school educators and their students. Beth Mora draws on the joy, laughter and the "opportunities for grace" of her journey in Christ to communicate that through all of life, our highest state is brokenness before a holy God and our greatest reward is to know Jesus more.</p>
