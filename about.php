She and her husband Forrest affectionately describe their step-family as yours, mine, ours and somebody else’s, having the privilege of adopting two teenage boys. She is a home school mom, with over fifteen years of experience.</p>
			<p>She has authored two home-schooling organization books entitled, <em>Organizationally Yours</em> for Kindergarten-eighth grade home schooling families and <em>Organize This</em> for high school students. She has a home-to-home style of communicating that warms the heart and encourages the reader and listener to take God at His word and apply it to life’s challenges.</p>
			<p>She is the founder of Here to Help Learning and loves teaching children. She has a life long dream of wanting to be “Mrs. Frizzle” (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_School_Bus">The Magic School Bus series</a>) when she grows up and secretly covets her outfits!</p>
			<p>She loves to teach God’s word to women of all ages and has been a guest speaker at varied women’s events as well as hosting a variety of workshops to encourage women as the “designers” of their home. She has performed in Church Easter and Christmas musicals for over 20 years and has also directed children’s drama and musicals.</p>
			<p>Beth and her husband Forrest serve as the directors of the Family Life ministry in their home church and teach marriage enrichment classes. They share a passion to see marriages, families, men and women experience the joy of living and growing together in Christ.</p>
