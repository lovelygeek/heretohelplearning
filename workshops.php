		<!--Organizationally Yours--><h3>Organizationally Yours</h3>
		<strong>TBA or On Request</strong>
		<br />Come on over to our house! I’m just your average home-school mom who has eight children and has home-schooled for over fifteen years. Five of our children have left the nest, two are attending high school, and I am left with one to home school, but I am not so old as to forget what home school life was like!</p>
		<p>Fond home schooling memories include the children and I gathered around the new cherry Kool-Aid® stain on the carpet, teaching my children the differences in the dye quality between cherry and yesterday’s Mega Mountain Twist Kool-Aid® stain. I remember the stacks of un-graded math and English papers that are sitting next to my cold cup of coffee. I never did seem to experience that “good to the last drop” feeling. Tears come to my eyes reminiscing about the baby chewing on the only centimeter ruler in the house warmed by the sounds of our seven-year old twins arguing about whether a pencil or a pen should be used for math. Memories of our ten-year old announcing that he finished an entire day’s worth of schooling in under an hour, and cherished pictures in my mind of our twelve-year old having fallen asleep with his literature book still propped up in both hands at 10:00am. So, if your home is experiencing a little chaos like mine did, then come on over, let’s have that second cup of coffee and let’s talk.</p> 
		<p>Although it can be challenging, my husband Forrest and I love home schooling. Our worse day home schooling is always better than anything else we do. It is one of the most rewarding endeavors we have ever chosen. I hope that this work shop will encourage and challenge you and even warm your heart.</p>

		Topics to be covered:
		<ul>
		<li>Organizing your home school</li>
		<li>Record keeping</li>
		<li>Tricks of the trade</li>
		<li>Creating a positive learning environment</li>
		<li>Planning your home schooling experience.</li>

		</ul>
