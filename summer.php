				<p>Can you play with a box all week? Your child can! Each child will receive an appliance size box and enough fabric, tape, construction paper, markers etc. to allow their imaginations to soar. Our "Box City" will emerge into a booming town. Children will be encouraged to bring in things they can sell and "Mora Bucks" will teach them about finances and economy. Your children will learn about inflation, savings and giving and most important-God's design for economy.</p>

					<h3>Math Facts</h3>
					<h4>July 31-August 3 OR August 7-10, 1:00-2:00pm</h4>
				</hrgroup>	
				
				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/here_to_help_learning/4221116995/" title="IMG_1229 by Here to Help Learning, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2757/4221116995_af0a8a7571_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="IMG_1229" class="dropshadow" /></a></p>
				
				<p>By the end of third grade, students should have all their addition, subtraction, multiplication and division facts not only committed to memory but have achieved what math teachers call automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to not have to think about the answer to a math fact, it just comes automatically. With the dawn of "new" math, many curriculums do not have a heavy emphasis on this type of rote learning. Children entering fourth grade math without having achieved this skill can experience a lot of frustration. This class will take the boredom out of rote learning. I use good old fashion techniques that our parents were taught when they were in school. Your child will learn as much about goal setting and study skills as they will about math facts. </p>
				
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Recommended Grade level:</strong> 1-6 who have not mastered their math facts.</li>
				<li>Math Fact Automaticity = 100 math facts (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) completed at 100% accuracy under 5:00 min. Click on an assessment test to check your child's level.</li>
				<li><strong>Fee:</strong> $40.00-Tuesday-Friday/4 classes</li>
				</ul>

				<br />To reserve your spot, we have a non-refundable $10.00 registration fee per class.
